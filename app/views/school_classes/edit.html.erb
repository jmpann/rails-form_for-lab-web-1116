<h3>School Class Form</h3>

<%= form_for(@school_class) do |f| %>
<!-- same exact form syntax as the new.html.erb form. formbuilder knows this initialized school_class already has atrribute values. thus it fills the text_filed with those values by looking at the [:school_class][:title] key -->

  <label>School Class Title: </label><br>
  <%= f.text_field :title %><br>

  <label>Room Number:</label><br>
  <%= f.text_field :room_number%> <br>

  <%=f.submit%>
<% end %>
